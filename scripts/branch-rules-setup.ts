/**
 * Gives a repository one ruleset per long-lived branch, `develop` and `main`,
 * each naming its branch, requiring pull requests, the named checks, signed
 * commits, and no deletion or force push (issue shyden-labs/repo-template#8). `develop` requires the
 * checks run on an up-to-date branch ("strict"); `main` does not, because each
 * release merge lands on `main` and never on squash-only `develop`, so a strict
 * `main` would refuse every cut after the first. `main` requires `release-cut`
 * in its place (issue shyden-labs/repo-template#86, docs/release-cut.md). Run once per repository, by
 * the operator (rulesets need admin rights), after `develop` becomes the
 * default branch:
 *
 *   node scripts/branch-rules-setup.ts <owner/repo> <required check>...
 *
 * It refuses a ruleset that targets ~DEFAULT_BRANCH: that target moves when the
 * default branch changes, which is how ShyTalk's `main` lost its rules on
 * 2026-10-13. It creates what is missing, updates what differs, and reads both
 * branches' rules back, failing unless develop is strict and main is not and
 * requires release-cut and lets main be created before its checks have run
 * (issue shyden-labs/repo-template#171), and unless develop takes pull requests by squash alone
 * and main by merge commit alone (issue shyden-labs/repo-template#115). It sets the repository to
 * delete merged head branches and refuse rebase merges, reads that back, then opens the `dev` environment, which holds the
 * dev credential, to every branch, and reads that back too (issue shyden-labs/repo-template#185,
 * replacing shyden-labs/repo-template#117's develop-only policy).
